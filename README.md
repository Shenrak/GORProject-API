# GORproject

## What's that project ?

The goal here is to provide a back-end API written in elixir using the Phoenix framework to support an open-source non-lucrative RPG chat. We want to offer an alternative to people that would like to enter in the P&P RPG world but do not feel confident with the action of speaking with strangers nor putting themselves forward.

The game master will have features to easely handle the means of a P&P RPG. We also want to provide a global hub in which you can join a session whenever the game master is able to introduce you to the game.

For the first version, we do not want to force users to create accounts.

## Contributing

Feel free to create issues and/or pull requests, we would love your contribution ! There's no small help :)
Remember following Elixir's syntax, and good practices.

## Setup

To create your PostgreSQL Database we recommend that you use [Postgres app](https://postgresapp.com/) on mac.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

To see which routes are currently available, run `mix phx.routes`

Now you can begin making requests on [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) with [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or another tool.
